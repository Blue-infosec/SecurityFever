# SecurityFever PowerShell Module

PowerShell Module with custom functions and cmdlets related to Windows and
application security.


## Introduction

This is a personal PowerShell Module by Claudio Spizzi. It is used to unite all
personal security related functions and cmdlets into one module.

You can invoke PowerShell scripts or script blocks in an elevated context with
**sudo** or test your credentials against the local system or an Active
Directory domain with **Test-Credential**.

With the security activity and audit policy cmdlets, you can get the security
related configuration of security audit events in the **Audit Policy** and check
the latest activity on the target computer.

With the **Vault** cmdlets, you can interact with the Windows Credential Manager
to store and received PowerShell credentials and secure strings. 


## Features

### Windows Credential Manager (Vault)

* **Get-VaultEntry**  
  With this cmdlet, the entires form the Windows Credential Manager vault can be
  retrieved. The entries contain a PSCredential object and all additional
  metadata like target name, type and persistence location.

* **Get-VaultEntryCredential**  
  This cmdlet works similar like the Get-VaultEntry, but returns only a native
  PSCredential object without additional metadata. This is useful if just the
  simple PSCredential object is required.

* **Get-VaultEntrySecureString**  
  This cmdlet works similar like the Get-VaultEntry, but returns only a native
  secure string object containing the password without additional metadata. This
  is useful if just the simple secure string object is required.

* **New-VaultEntry**  
  Create a new entry in the Windows Credential Manager vault. The credential
  type and persist location can be specified. By default, a generic entry with
  no special purpose is created on the local machine persist location. It will
  not override existing entries.

* **Update-VaultEntry**  
  Update an existing entry in the Windows Credential Manager vault. The
  credential target name and type are required to identify the entry to update.
  The persist location and the credentials (or username/password) can be
  updated.

* **Remove-VaultEntry**  
  Remove an existing entry in the Windows Credential Manager vault. The cmdlet
  accepts pipeline input with credential entry objects.

### Audit Policy

* **Get-SecurityAuditPolicy**  
  List the current local security audit policy settings. It will execute the
  auditpol.exe command and parse the result into objects.

* **Get-SecurityAuditPolicySetting**  
  Return the value of one security audit policy setting. It will use the
  Get-SecurityAuditPolicy cmdlet and just filter and expand the result. 

### Other

* **Invoke-Elevated**  
  Invoke a script block or an executable in an elevated session. It will handle
  the parameter passing into the elevated session and return the result as
  object to the caller. Because it's running in a different elevated process,
  XML serialization is used to return the result. The cmdlet has the alias
  **sudo**, as used on *nix systems.

* **Invoke-PowerShell**  
  Start a new PowerShell Console session with alternative credentials. The
  cmdlet has the alias **posh**.

* **Test-Credential**  
  With this cmdlet, credential objects or username and password pairs can be
  tested, if they are valid. With the method parameter, it's possible to choose
  how the credentials are validated (start process, Active Directory). Be aware,
  multiple testing with wrong credentials can lock out the used account
  depending on your security settings. 

* **Get-SecurityActivity**  
  Get security and life-cycle related events on the target computer like start
  up / shutdown, user log on / log off, workstation locked /unlocked, session
  reconnected / disconnected and screen saver invoke / dismiss.
